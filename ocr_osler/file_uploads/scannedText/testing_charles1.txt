dreamed in Teixcalaanli half the time; had
dreamed of the City often enough—but reach-
ing for the place where she’d felt the weight of
him since he’d been joined to her made her
feel that dizzying, horrible falling sensation
again. She sat down on the edge of the bed
and looked at the squared-off edges of the
codexes until she was sure she wasn’t going
to faint. Whoever had cleaned the rooms had
arranged them, which implied that anything
obviously incriminating had been removed.

She was already thinking about

Of course she was thinking incriminating.
Assume deception, she told herself. Assume
foul play and double meanings. Choked on the
air. Allergies, or breathing something too rar-

but the imago was out of date. A man might

er, an error, she’d wake up tomorrow and he’d
be here) she was going to have to think about
sabotage right along with incriminating. Some-
thing had gone wrong with her imago-
machine—either sabotage or mechanical fail-
ure. Or personal failure to integrate. It could be
her own fault. Her own psychology, rejecting
his. She shuddered. Her hands still felt prickly
and strange.

“Your luggage is processed and yours

the irised door of Yskandr’s bedroom. Mahit
sat up very straight and tried to look like she
